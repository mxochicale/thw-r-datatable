* The minor issue for this presentation was the need of an
micro-HDMI to VGA adapter to connect the Ubuntu14.04x64 machine, 
however, the organiser, were of much help  because after
a not successful remote conection, he asked one of the guys in 
the audience to borrow his mac machine to run the code!

* The audience for the presentation were modest, probably ten persons (
only one female!) and receive two questions:

	* Why to use data.table as you can get the same results 
	without using it with ggplot()?
	The anwers is that data.table is good for faster data manipulation,
	so having big files improves the performance of the code and 
	therefore you create plots more quickly.

	(extra: If I were to store any data from the whole living human
	being, I guess I have to have a tool that works very efficient.
	That would be data.table for for python users `pydatatable`)

	* Why you are not using pandas?
	The main reason is that the computational efficiency of 
	data.table, however I am considering to use `pydatable`
	as there are many package in python that would be 	
	computationally faster.


* It as a good experience to give this talk. Trying to explain something
to more people is a challange because in that way I know how much 
I don't know. Also, my way of speaking probably were not the most fluent, 
besides, I would say that I was a bit nervous, however, 
it went well after all, I started to feel more confident with the use of 
the Rstudio in the mac and therefore I was able, I guess, to explain 
the commands better.

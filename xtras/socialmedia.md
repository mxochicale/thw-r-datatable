Probably, my last contribution at @unibirmingham will be this Monday September 17th 2018,
in which I will give a short talk about my experience with the use of R data.table package.

Title: "A brief introduction to R data.table package" or if you like 
"If Thor was an R Programmer, His Hammer Would Be data.table"
Abstract: 
In this 20-minutes talk, I will present basic examples of the use of 
`data.table` which is an R package that provides an enhanced version 
of data.frames. I will also share some of my experiences with 
data.table and ggplot2 for time-series analyses.
